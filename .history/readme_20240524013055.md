# Graph RAG

## Introduction

 Graph  RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a technology that uses graph databases to store relationships between data points, replacing traditional text embedding methods like Chuck and enhancing the performance of RAG. This project is base on [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master) and [Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Features

- Create a RAG from PDFs
- Connect to Zotero to retrival PDFs
- Graph visulation through Neo4j Browser
- All data are stored locally, supporting llama.cpp and Ollama local LLM

## Installation

First, you need to install Neo4j. Download [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/) or Mac can install with homebrew
```
brew install --cask neo4j
```
1. Launch Neo4j Desktop, create a New Project and add a new Graph DBMS.

2. Enter the password into the [config.ini](./config.ini) - Neo4j - password. Then click on the Graph DBMS created in the last step and install APOC plugin.

3. Start the Graph DBMS.
   
Secondly, install dependencies
```
pip install requitements
```

Thirdly, config the zotero. [Pyzotero](https://github.com/urschrei/pyzotero) is used to connect to Zotero library. You'll need the ID of the personal or group library you want to access:
- Your personal library ID is available [here](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys), in the section Your userID for use in API calls (you may need to login). Enter you ID into [config.ini](./config.ini)
- For group libraries, the ID can be found by opening the group's page: https://www.zotero.org/groups/groupname, and hovering over the group settings link. The ID is the integer after /groups/
- You'll also need to get an API key [here](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys/new), enter you API key into [config.ini](./config.ini)
- Are you accessing your own Zotero library? library_type is 'user'
- Are you accessing a shared group library? library_type is 'group'.

Finally, modify the [config.ini](./config.ini), choose to use ollama or openai (llama.cpp), enter the directory where the zotero attachments are stored and so on.

## Usage
To convert PDF files into graph, just use the dpf2graph.py
```
python pdf2graph.py
```
Enter the path to the PDF file or just enter the title of the paper stored in Zotero library.
